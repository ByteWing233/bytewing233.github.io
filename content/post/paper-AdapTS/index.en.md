## One-Sentence Summary

This paper proposes a lightweight framework called **AdapTS** that dynamically combines predictions from a small model (AdapTS-Forecaster) learned online with predictions from a pre-trained, fixed foundation model (FM), enabling efficient utilization of new data to adapt to distribution changes and continuously improve time series forecasting performance after model deployment.

## Core Problem

This paper aims to solve a very practical and important problem:
